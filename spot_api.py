            angles: the angle(s) that the joints should be set to
            times: For a given index `i`, `times[i]` describe how long Spot has to change its arm's angles from those stored in `angles[i - 1]` to the angles in `angles[i]`. `times[0]` describes how long Spot has to move its arm from its current position to the one described by angles `angles[0]`. If `times` is a number, then that number is used for all times i.e. it becomes `[times] * len(angles)`.
            max_acceleration: the maximum acceleration that Spot's arm is allowed to undergo while moving its joints
            max_velocity: the maximum velocity that Spot's arm is allowed to travel at
            timeout: How long (in seconds) Spot has to move its arm through all the angles in `angles` before timing out. Note that if the times in `times` add up to an amount greater than this value then this method is gaurenteed to always time out.
